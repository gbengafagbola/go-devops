### HTTP-GET REQUEST

#### this is a simple project that shows the inner workings behind the mechnics of parsing json data from an endpoint

we are going to make an http-get request, I would run a go server locally and write a client to make a connection to the local http-server and output its response (http-code and http-body)

Using External API's,
1. make a connection request to the server (http request)
2. Retrieve the response data
3. Parse the data
